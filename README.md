## About me
ðŸ“š I am Ivana, a data science student at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) focused on building an interdisciplinary data analytics approach and implementing cloud computing solutions, primarily through AWS.

  - Currently, I am looking forward to professionally applying my SQL and Python knowledge to the data engineering field, scripting batch or real-time ELT/ETL pipelines.
  - My interest in each of the stages in the data lifecycle has lead me to constantly learn about tools such as Databricks, Power BI, Apache frameworks and ML libraries.

Take a look at my projects to get a hint of my work methodology, coding strategies and algorithmic approach influenced by academic computer science.
